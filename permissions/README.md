 Permissions Project

This project contains a series of Linux shell scripting exercises 
focused on file and directory permissions. 

Each task in the permissions directory demonstrates practical use 
of commands like chmod, chown, su, and groups to manage 
ownership, permissions, and user operations. 

The scripts are designed to reinforce understanding of Linux security, 
user management, and file access control.
